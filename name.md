Prefix names not to be exposed with a "\_": `_th` and `_do_something`.

## Name variables

Use two characters: "thing" ➡ `th`.

Pluralize by suffixing with (the number of preceding "_" + 1) "_"s: "things" ➡ `th_`.

Uppercase global ones: `TH`.

Name within the smallest context.

Name after content (not data structure or type).

Name as generally as possible.

Names must never be false.

Name numbers with equations in mind: probability ➡ `pr`, entropy ➡ `en`, fraction ➡ `fr`, and number of things ➡ `um`.

Differentiate ones with the same content by numbering: `t1` and `t2`.

Differentiate ones with different content by shifting: mean `me` and median `ed`.

## Name functions

Name explicitly: `do_something()`.

Differentiate by removing a character: `do_somethin()`.
