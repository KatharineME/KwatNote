## Name variables

Name after content.

Name as generally as possible without risking being false.

Name within the smallest context.

When using external tools, use their names.

Use two characters: thing ➡ `th`.

Uppercase global ones: `TH`.

They are sensitive: `th` != `TH` and `in_` != `in`.

Pluralize by adding one underscore: things ➡ `th_`.

Use one uppercase for matrices: Distance matrix ➡ `D`.

Differentiate ones with the same content type by numbering: number 1 `n1` and number 2 `n2`.

Differentiate ones with different content types by shifting: mean `me` and median `ed`.
