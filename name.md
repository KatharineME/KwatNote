## Name variables

Use two characters: "thing" ➡ `th`.

Use one uppercase character for matrices: "Distance matrix" ➡ `D`.

Pluralize by adding one "_": "things" ➡ `th_`.

Uppercase global ones: `TH`.

Name within the smallest context.

Name after content (not data structure or type).

Name as generally as possible without risking being false.

When using external tools, use their standard names.

Differentiate ones with the same content by numbering: `t1` and `t2`.

Differentiate ones with different content by shifting: mean `me` and median `ed`.

## Name functions

Name explicitly: `do_something()`.

Differentiate by removing a character: `do_somethin()`.
