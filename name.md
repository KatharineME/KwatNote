Name objects using the most specific computer physics (how they are stored) or algorithm (how they are computed).

Name collections by their content.

Keep external names.

Use two characters: string ➡ `st`.

Uppercase global ones: `ST`.

Pluralize by adding one underscore: strings ➡ `st_`.

Use one uppercase for matrices and tables: Distance matrix ➡ `D`.

Differentiate ones with the same content type by numbering: number 1 `n1` and number 2 `n2`.

Differentiate ones with different content types by shifting: mean `me` and median `ed`.

Limit function names

- `lo*`
- `update*!`
- `ge*`
- `is*`
- `index*`
- `make*`
- `text*`
- `path*`
- `rea*`
- `writ*`

Differentiate function names by removing a character: `write` and `writ`.
